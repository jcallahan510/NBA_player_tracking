# NBA_player_tracking
This repo contains my work deriving a new NBA statistic, xeFG%, from the publicly available player tracking data from the 2015-16 NBA season.

Please reference the various R and Python files in their numbered order if you wish to reproduce my work. The necessary data is contained in the Data folder, and images spot checking shot attempt times are in the Images folder.

My final report is included in PDF formmat.
